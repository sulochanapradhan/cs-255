# CS-255 - System Analysis and Design - DriverPass Project

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project wanted to solve the void in the student training program that is causing 60% failure in the DMV driving test. The client is DriverPass, and they want to build a web application to provide training packages that include online training, exams, and on-road lessons.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well in different areas. I think I did particularly well in writing different system design documents. It includes the design document with UML diagrams. I have learned different UML diagrams, and their importance in system analysis, and design.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revise the use case diagram. I believe I have captured most of the use cases, but I feel I have missed some “include” and “extend” relationships. For example, when purchasing the package, the credit card needs to be verified and can have a relationship to include a verification use case.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The system needs to be based on the user’s needs. The first step of any system is to gather the user’s requirements, refine them, analyze them, and design the system. It is an iterative process, and it is important for the analyst to understand the requirements. There can be a few changes in the requirements, but the core business idea needs to be the same. The functional and non-functional requirements need to identify properly while analyzing and designing. So, as an analyst, the requirements act as the input for the system analysis and design. Moreover, the analysts should be able to distinguish between needs and wants. The priority should be always given to the needs.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Identifying the functional, and non-functional requirements is an important step in any software design. In fact, these requirements get turned into the user story later that allows both testers, and developers to work simultaneously. After preparing the business requirement document, we can create different diagrams to support our design and make it understandable to the customer. These diagrams are important not just for technical persons but also for non-technical persons like stakeholders to know how the purposed systems would work. I would use different UML diagrams along with BRD to analyze and design the system.
